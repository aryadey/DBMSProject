 Title: Weather Data Analysis Database Project

Description:

This Database Management System (DBMS) project focuses on storing and analyzing weather data to provide valuable insights. The system will include data collection, storage, and analysis components, enabling users to access historical and real-time weather information. Key features include data ingestion from various sources (e.g., sensors, APIs), data cleansing, storage in a relational database, and interactive querying for weather trends and forecasts. Users can retrieve climate patterns, temperature fluctuations, precipitation levels, and generate graphical representations. The system will offer user-friendly interfaces for data input, query execution, and data visualization. Additionally, it may support automated alerts for severe weather conditions and integration with external services like weather forecasting models.
